      <h1>Chattanooga's History</h1>
      <p>Chattanooga, located in southeastern Tennessee, is a city rich in history and natural beauty. From its early industrial roots to its current position as a leader in innovation, Chattanooga offers a unique blend of old and new.</p>
      <p>Chattanooga was established in 1838 as a small trading post called "Rossâ€™s Landing," named after Major John Ross, the Cherokee Chief. It became a key transportation hub due to its location at the confluence of the Tennessee River and several important Native American trade routes.</p>
      <p>In recent decades, Chattanooga has undergone a significant transformation. The city has worked to clean up pollution, revitalize its riverfront, and attract a diverse range of industries, including technology and green energy. It is now a recognized leader in sustainability and innovation, earning the title of "Gig City" after becoming the first city in the U.S. to offer high-speed fiber-optic internet.</p>
